# Student Average Calculator
## A program created in Python using CSV libraries and TKinter for Old Scona Academic's administration to calculate each student's best academic average from a central spreadsheet efficiently. 
#### There are five different ways a student's average can be calculated. Their Language Arts grade must be used in addition to either:
#### - Four other core subjects
#### - Three core subjects and one 5-credit options course
#### - Three core subjects and two 3-credit options course
#### - Three core subjects and five 1-credit options course
#### - Three core subjects, one 3-credit options course, and two 1-credit options course
#### The scenario resulting in the highest average is recorded as the average for each student. 

#### The program contains error checks that will notify the user if a student is missing mandatory courses or if a course code is unrecognized. The user can upload new course codes if needed.
